# C# Loop Demos

This repository contains C# code samples demonstrating different types of loops and their usage.

## Description

Loops are an essential part of programming, allowing sections of code to be executed repeatedly based on certain conditions. This repository provides examples of the following types of loops:

1. **`while` Loop**: Executes a block of code repeatedly while a specified condition is true.
2. **`do while` Loop**: Similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is false.
3. **`for` Loop**: Executes a block of code a specified number of times, with optional initialization, condition check, and increment or decrement.

Additionally, the repository includes examples of:

- Infinite loops and how to break out of them.
- Using loops in menu-driven programs.
- Finding factorial using a `for` loop.

## Demos Included

1. **Simple `do while` Loop**: Counting numbers up to 100.
2. **Counting Every 100 Numbers**: Using a `do while` loop with user input to continue or stop counting.
3. **Infinite Loop**: Demonstrating an infinite loop and breaking out of it.
4. **Menu-Driven Program**: Using a `do while` loop with a menu to perform arithmetic operations.
5. **Factorial Finding**: Using a `for` loop to calculate the factorial of a number.

## Usage

To run any of the demos, you'll need to have a C# compiler installed on your system. You can compile and execute the code using your preferred C# development environment or the command line.

For example, to compile and run the `FactorialFinding.cs` demo using the command line:
